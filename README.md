# üé≤ MathRox

It's not rolling dice ‚Äî it's RNG... with _style_! A Discord bot with the aim of being at least some sort of replacement for the fantastic (late) [Sidekick Bot](https://github.com/ArtemGr/Sidekick)

## ü•Ö Project Goals

Provide a simple, easy to use interface for dice rolling and simple mathematic expression solving, wrapped up in a discord interface.

## üí° Inspiration

Almost entirely born out of a desire to replace the late [Sidekick](https://github.com/ArtemGr/Sidekick) Discord bot, this looked like a great project to tinker around with some newer C# as well as getting a powerful dice expression parser and roller.
